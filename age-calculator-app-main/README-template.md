### What I learned

During the course of this project i learnt how well to make use of the object and arrays in javascript, i also learnt how to use dark and light mood.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
input:checked + .slider:before {
    -webkit-transform: translateX(26px);
    -ms-transform: translateX(26px);
    transform: translateX(26px);
}
```
```js
modeToggle.addEventListener('change', function () {
        if (modeToggle.checked) {
            body.classList.add('dark-mode');
        } else {
            body.classList.remove('dark-mode');
        }
    });
```
